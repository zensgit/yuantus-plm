# Stage 1 Development Report - CAD Preview Reliability

Date: 2026-01-09

## Goal
Codify DWG/DXF preview reliability with a repeatable sample matrix and
failure taxonomy.

## Changes Delivered
- Added a consolidated sample matrix document that links existing scan and
  validation reports.

## Files Touched
- `docs/CADGF_PREVIEW_SAMPLE_MATRIX.md`

## Notes
- Failure classes are now explicitly listed to guide future triage
  (unsupported entities, no geometry, timeouts).
