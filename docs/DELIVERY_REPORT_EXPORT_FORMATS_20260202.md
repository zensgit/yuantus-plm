# Report Export Formats (2026-02-02)

## Supported Formats

- `csv` (default)
- `json`

## CSV

- UTF-8 with BOM (`utf-8-sig`) for Excel compatibility.
- Columns are derived from `data.columns` if present; otherwise inferred from item keys.
- Nested objects/arrays are serialized to JSON strings in each cell.

## JSON

- Returns full payload (`items`, `total`, `columns`, etc.) exactly as generated by the report.
- Useful for programmatic processing.

## Notes

- Use `page` and `page_size` to control export size.
- Large exports should be paginated and stitched externally if needed.
