# Claude Taskbook: CAD Helper Bridge S9 - NETLOAD Lisp Transport Bridge

Date: 2026-05-23

Type: **Doc-only taskbook.** Changes no runtime, no schema, no workflow, and no
CAD bridge code. It specifies the contract a later, separately opted-in
implementation PR will deliver. Merging this taskbook does NOT authorize that
implementation.

## 1. Purpose

CAD Desktop Helper Bridge **S9-R1** adds the native-CAD bridge DLL boundary from
the R3.2 design:

- new `clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll` source;
- .NET Framework v4.6 / `net46` NETLOAD compatibility;
- `ProjectReference` to `Yuantus.Cad.Shared` using the `net46` target;
- exactly one Lisp-callable transport primitive:

```lisp
(yuantus-helper-call "<endpoint>" "<json-request-string>")
```

S9-R1 is only the thin transport bridge from native CAD Lisp into the already
merged helper process. It does **not** add Lisp command files, does **not** add
`YUANTUS_DIFF_PREVIEW`, does **not** parse business diff payloads, does **not**
write DWG fields, and does **not** add helper server routes. Those are S10/S11
or later opt-in slices.

S9-R1 also does **not** implement `/dedup/check`, `/shell/notify`, `/compose`,
`/validate`, `/tasks`, `/diagnostics/snapshot`, CORS, PLM routes, database
schema, tenant baseline data, or AutoCAD `CADDedupPlugin` behavior. S8 already
migrated the supported AutoCAD plugin MaterialSync calls; S9 is for the
native-CAD Lisp route only.

## 2. Grounded Current Reality

Grounded against `origin/main = 90d80c55` after S8 merged.

### 2.1 R3.2 design anchors

`docs/CAD_DESKTOP_HELPER_BRIDGE_DESIGN_R3_20260519.md` defines the S9 surface:

- Lines 107-112 define `YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll` as the native-CAD route:
  .NET Framework v4.6, Shared `net46`, and only
  `(yuantus-helper-call endpoint json) -> json`.
- Lines 115-120 define constraints: helper is an external process, CAD-side
  clients do not directly call PLM, Lisp does not directly send HTTP, read
  DPAPI, or hold tokens, and `CADDedupPlugin` does not go through the Lisp
  bridge.
- Lines 130-131 reject `netstandard2.0` for Shared/Bridge compatibility and
  pin the Bridge to full .NET Framework v4.6.
- Lines 700-724 define the mechanics: NETLOAD `YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll`,
  export one Lisp function, use Shared to discover/start helper, read the local
  helper token through Shared, synchronously call helper, and print sanitized
  error information to the CAD command line.
- Lines 810-825 list manual evidence. Case 9 is the native-CAD smoke:
  ZWCAD true-machine load of the Lisp shell plus bridge DLL, run
  `YUANTUS_DIFF_PREVIEW`, display `write_cad_fields`, and record
  `/audit/apply-result` as `not-applied-display-only`.
- Lines 983-987 list the intended `clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/` project.
- Lines 991-1009 define the reference graph: Shared multi-targets
  `net46;net6.0-windows`, and Bridge references Shared's `net46` target.
- Lines 1065-1071 define S9 as the NETLOAD adapter plus
  `(yuantus-helper-call ...)`; S10 depends on S9.

### 2.2 Current repository state

Current CAD-helper directories:

```text
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Shared/
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Shared.Tests/
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Detector/
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Detector.Tests/
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Helper/
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Helper.Tests/
```

There is no `clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/` and no
`YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll` source yet.

### 2.3 S1 Shared primitives inherited by S9

S1 already provides the primitives S9 must consume:

- `Yuantus.Cad.Shared` multi-targets `net46;net6.0-windows`.
- `HelperLocator.EnsureHelperRunningAsync(...)` resolves a healthy helper base
  URI or starts `yuantus-cad-helper.exe`, using a 5 second max wait and the
  session-file / `/healthz` probe flow.
- `HelperTransport` injects `X-Yuantus-Local-Token` and
  `X-Yuantus-Protocol`.
- `HelperTransport` parses the helper response envelope and throws
  `HelperException` on helper errors.
- `LocalTokenStore` keeps DPAPI token access inside Shared.

S9-R1 must reuse Shared. It must not duplicate helper discovery, local-token
reading, response-envelope parsing, or helper process spawning.

### 2.4 Helper route surface inherited by S9

After S8, production helper routes remain exactly ten:

```text
GET  /healthz
GET  /version
POST /session/login
POST /session/logout
GET  /session/status
POST /cad/current-drawing
POST /diff/preview
POST /sync/inbound
POST /sync/outbound
POST /audit/apply-result
```

S9-R1 must not add or remove helper server routes. It is a CAD-host transport
DLL only.

### 2.5 Native-CAD SDK reality

The bridge must be NETLOAD-compatible inside CAD processes. The host adapter may
need CAD managed runtime APIs for Lisp registration, argument buffers, and
command-line output.

The normal GitHub Windows runner can build/test SDK-free .NET code, but it does
not provide AutoCAD, ZWCAD, or GstarCAD managed assemblies. Therefore S9-R1 must
split verification honestly:

- CI covers SDK-free bridge-core behavior and static source guards.
- True NETLOAD/build/load behavior remains deferred Windows + native-CAD
  operational signoff unless the owner supplies a real CAD SDK/host for the PR.

Deferred evidence is not a substitute for real validation; it is explicit risk
acceptance for a repo-only slice.

## 3. S9-R1 Decisions And Boundaries

### 3.A Project shape and target

S9-R1 adds:

```text
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/YuantusCadHelperBridge.csproj
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/*.cs
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge.Tests/Yuantus.Cad.Bridge.Tests.csproj
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge.Tests/*.cs
```

The bridge DLL output must be .NET Framework v4.6 / `net46`.

The implementation may use either:

- classic `<TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.6</TargetFrameworkVersion>`; or
- SDK-style `<TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>`.

If SDK-style `net46` is used, the PR body and DEV/Verification MD must disclose
the syntax deviation from the R3.2 illustrative text and show that the output is
still .NET Framework v4.6.

`YuantusCadHelperBridge.csproj` must reference
`..\Shared\Yuantus.Cad.Shared.csproj` and consume Shared's `net46` target.

### 3.B Single Lisp callable primitive

S9-R1 exposes exactly one Lisp-callable primitive:

```lisp
(yuantus-helper-call "<endpoint>" "<json-request-string>")
```

The primitive accepts exactly two string arguments:

1. `endpoint` - helper endpoint path;
2. `json-request-string` - JSON object request body.

No third argument, implicit profile selector, drawing-path auto-fill, or CAD
business option belongs to S9. Those are S10+ command concerns.

Arity mismatch is deterministic: 0, 1, or 3+ arguments returns `nil` and writes
one sanitized CAD command-line error:

```text
[YUANTUS_HELPER_CALL_FAILED] code=HELPER_INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED reason=arity
```

If the CAD host requires an uppercase registration symbol, the lower-case Lisp
spelling must still work and the implementation PR must document the host API
behavior.

### 3.C Endpoint validation is mandatory

S9 introduces a generic endpoint string from Lisp. This is the new S9-specific
security risk.

`HelperTransport` creates request URIs from a base URI and caller path. If S9
forwarded an absolute URL such as `https://evil.example/collect`, the bridge
could send the local helper token outside loopback.

Therefore S9-R1 must validate `endpoint` before any transport call:

- non-empty string;
- starts with exactly one `/`;
- rejects `//...` network-path references;
- rejects absolute URI schemes such as `http://`, `https://`, `file://`;
- rejects Windows UNC paths such as `\\host\share`;
- rejects backslashes;
- rejects `%` entirely, including percent-encoded slash, backslash, null, CR,
  LF, tab, and scheme-confusion attempts;
- rejects CR, LF, tab, and other control characters;
- rejects whitespace-only or leading/trailing whitespace variants;
- treats the value as a helper-relative path only.

S9-R1 does **not** maintain a business endpoint allowlist. The helper's S4/S5/S6
gates remain authoritative for auth/source/session/business policy. The S9 guard
is specifically a token-exfiltration and URI-confusion guard.

### 3.D JSON request handling

`json-request-string` must be parsed before forwarding:

- it must be valid JSON;
- it must be a JSON object;
- invalid JSON returns `nil` and writes a sanitized bridge error to the CAD
  command line;
- valid objects are forwarded through Shared transport;
- S9 must not parse business fields such as `item_id`, `write_cad_fields`,
  `applied_fields`, profile ids, CAD properties, or drawing contents.

The bridge may deserialize to `JObject` / `JToken` only to preserve JSON shape
for transport. That is not business parsing.

### 3.E Response shape

S9-R1 uses existing `HelperTransport` semantics:

- successful helper responses return the helper `data` payload serialized as a
  JSON string;
- helper `ok=false`, HTTP 4xx/5xx, protocol mismatch, local-token failure,
  helper-startup failure, DPAPI failure, and transport exceptions return `nil`;
- failures also write one sanitized command-line message containing an error
  code and short reason;
- token values, bearer values, full request bodies, and full response bodies
  must not be printed.

When helper success has no `data` member or has `"data": null`, S9 returns the
literal JSON string `null`. This keeps `nil` reserved for bridge/helper failure
and makes a successful JSON-null payload distinguishable from transport failure.

This is a deliberate S9-R1 contract: the Lisp bridge returns the data payload,
not the full helper envelope. S10 command Lisp must consume that data shape.

### 3.F Synchronous CAD-host boundary

Lisp calls are synchronous. S9-R1 may block the CAD command while the helper call
is in flight.

The implementation should use an explicit sync wrapper around async Shared calls
such as `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`, rather than `Task.Result` or `Task.Wait()`,
so exceptions are not hidden behind `AggregateException`.

S9-R1 does not implement cancellation propagation. Existing AutoCAD plugin calls
also do not propagate command cancellation into HTTP requests; this is not a new
regression.

### 3.G Error output to CAD command line

On failure, S9-R1 writes a short sanitized message to the CAD command line.

Minimum format:

```text
[YUANTUS_HELPER_CALL_FAILED] code=<code> reason=<short>
```

Rules:

- no local helper token;
- no PLM bearer;
- no request JSON;
- no response body;
- no filesystem paths except sanitized categories/basenames;
- no stack traces;
- one line per call failure.

The adapter may use the CAD host's editor/command-line API. SDK-free tests
should validate formatting through a narrow message-writer seam.

The production CAD command-line writer itself is a host seam. If the PR cannot
exercise the real CAD writer in CI, that real-writer evidence is deferred to the
same native-CAD NETLOAD operational signoff in §3.K; the SDK-free writer tests
are not allowed to claim real-host coverage.

### 3.H No helper server route changes

S9-R1 is a client DLL slice. It must not edit helper Kestrel route declarations.

Specifically, S9-R1 must not add:

- `/shell/notify`;
- `/dedup/check`;
- `/compose`;
- `/validate`;
- `/tasks`;
- `/diagnostics/snapshot`;
- CORS;
- any IPC route for Lisp.

The production helper route count remains exactly ten after S9-R1.

`/shell/notify` appears in the R3.2 endpoint table, but it is not assigned to
S9 in the work-breakdown row. It remains S10/S11+ scope unless separately
opted in.

### 3.I No DWG or business logic

`YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll` must not:

- write DWG fields;
- inspect block attributes;
- parse `write_cad_fields`;
- decide `applied_fields` or `failed_fields`;
- implement `YUANTUS_DIFF_PREVIEW`;
- display diff tables;
- open modal UI;
- call PLM directly;
- use `HttpClient` directly except through Shared transport;
- read DPAPI directly except through Shared;
- parse CAD-specific business payloads.

S10 owns native-CAD Lisp commands and command-line presentation. Any future
native-CAD write-back adapter is a later slice with real host validation.

### 3.J CI and workflow posture

S9-R1 implementation must update `.github/workflows/cad-helper-shared-dotnet.yml`
so changes under these paths trigger the Windows dotnet workflow:

```text
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/**
clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge.Tests/**
```

The workflow must at least run SDK-free bridge contract tests and a static
verifier. The implementation PR must explicitly state which of these is true:

- the actual Bridge project builds on the GitHub Windows runner; or
- the actual Bridge host adapter is static-verified while SDK-free core logic is
  unit-tested, with true NETLOAD build/load deferred to operational signoff.

Silent "tests green" language is not allowed unless the relevant build/load
actually ran.

### 3.K Deferred native-CAD operational evidence

S9-R1 implementation may merge with deferred operational signoff only if the PR
body and DEV/Verification MD state it plainly.

Deferred evidence must include:

- Windows + AutoCAD or ZWCAD/GstarCAD host with `NETLOAD`;
- bridge DLL loads without missing dependency errors;
- `(yuantus-helper-call "/diff/preview" "{...}")` starts or finds helper;
- success returns a JSON string with helper data;
- error path returns nil and prints sanitized error code;
- the production CAD command-line writer path, not only the SDK-free writer
  seam, prints that sanitized error;
- no token appears in CAD command-line output;
- if paired with S10 later, `YUANTUS_DIFF_PREVIEW` display-only flow records
  `/audit/apply-result` as `not-applied-display-only`.

If this evidence is not collected in S9-R1, it remains a carried-forward S11 or
operational signoff obligation.

## 4. Implementation Shape For The Later PR

Recommended implementation shape:

1. Add `clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/`.
2. Add `YuantusCadHelperBridge.csproj` targeting .NET Framework v4.6 / `net46`.
3. Reference `..\Shared\Yuantus.Cad.Shared.csproj`.
4. Add a small SDK-free core service, for example `BridgeCallService`, that:
   - validates endpoint;
   - parses the JSON object;
   - calls `HelperLocator.EnsureHelperRunningAsync(...)`;
   - creates `HelperTransport`;
   - posts the JSON object to the validated helper-relative endpoint;
   - serializes the returned data payload to a JSON string;
   - maps failures to a bridge result.
5. Add the CAD-host adapter that registers the Lisp primitive and delegates to
   the core service.
6. Add a narrow command-line writer seam so tests can verify sanitized failure
   output without AutoCAD.
7. Add `clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge.Tests/` SDK-free tests and source
   guards.
8. Update `cad-helper-shared-dotnet` workflow path filters and test steps.
9. Add `docs/DEV_AND_VERIFICATION_CAD_HELPER_BRIDGE_S9_LISP_BRIDGE_R1_20260523.md`.
10. Update `docs/DELIVERY_DOC_INDEX.md`.

If the host adapter cannot compile on the repo's Windows runner without native
CAD assemblies, the PR must not fake the result. Keep host-specific code
static-verified, keep core logic unit-tested, and document deferred NETLOAD
evidence.

## 5. Mandatory Tests For The Later PR

S9 implementation must add these exactly named tests:

1. `test_s9_bridge_project_targets_net46_and_references_shared_net46`
2. `test_s9_bridge_exposes_exactly_one_lisp_function_yuantus_helper_call`
3. `test_s9_lisp_function_accepts_endpoint_and_json_string_arguments_only`
4. `test_s9_rejects_absolute_uri_network_path_backslash_and_control_char_endpoint_before_transport`
5. `test_s9_rejects_missing_or_non_object_json_request_without_calling_transport`
6. `test_s9_posts_valid_json_object_to_helper_through_shared_locator_and_transport`
7. `test_s9_returns_helper_data_payload_as_json_string_on_success`
8. `test_s9_returns_nil_and_writes_sanitized_error_on_helper_exception`
9. `test_s9_error_output_never_contains_local_token_request_body_or_response_body`
10. `test_s9_sync_wrapper_preserves_helper_exception_code_without_aggregate_exception`
11. `test_s9_adds_no_helper_server_routes_and_preserves_route_count_ten`
12. `test_s9_does_not_add_shell_notify_dedup_check_compose_validate_tasks_or_diagnostics_routes`
13. `test_s9_bridge_contains_no_dwg_write_business_diff_parsing_or_modal_ui_logic`
14. `test_s9_bridge_uses_shared_helper_locator_transport_and_local_token_store_only`
15. `test_s9_bridge_core_is_sdk_free_contract_testable_without_native_cad`
16. `test_s9_workflow_runs_bridge_contracts_and_static_verifier`
17. `test_s9_static_verifier_rejects_absolute_uri_forwarding_and_direct_httpclient_token_reads`
18. `test_s9_dev_verification_records_deferred_native_cad_netload_signoff`
19. `test_s9_s10_dependency_is_documented_and_no_lisp_shell_command_files_are_added`
20. `test_s9_static_wiring_reaches_production_helper_locator_and_transport`

Test 6 is a fake-based S9 wiring assertion: it must verify strict call shape
(endpoint and JSON object forwarded unchanged after validation), method
selection, sequencing, and failure short-circuit behavior. It must not be
described as production OS/FS/network seam coverage. Production seam coverage
for `HelperLocator` and `HelperTransport` is inherited from S1 Shared tests; S9
adds test 20 and the static verifier so the bridge cannot silently replace those
production Shared seams with local fakes or duplicate implementations.

Recommended static/source guards:

- no `MapGet(` / `MapPost(` additions in helper source;
- no `/shell/notify`, `/dedup/check`, `/compose`, `/validate`, `/tasks`, or
  `/diagnostics/snapshot` route declarations;
- no direct `HttpClient` construction in Bridge core;
- no `ProtectedData` / DPAPI access in Bridge;
- no local-token direct read outside Shared transport;
- no direct `Process.Start` in Bridge except through Shared `HelperLocator` /
  `HelperSpawner`;
- no `CadMaterialFieldService`, `write_cad_fields`, `AppliedFields`, or DWG
  mutation logic;
- Bridge core wiring reaches Shared `HelperLocator` and `HelperTransport` (or a
  narrowly injectable factory whose production implementation does so);
- no `CADDedupPlugin` edits;
- no `DedupApiClient` edits;
- workflow includes Bridge path filters and Bridge tests/static verifier;
- DEV/Verification MD exists and is indexed.

## 6. Verification Commands For This Taskbook PR

This doc-only taskbook PR should run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q \
  src/yuantus/meta_engine/tests/test_delivery_doc_index_references.py \
  src/yuantus/meta_engine/tests/test_dev_and_verification_doc_index_completeness.py \
  src/yuantus/meta_engine/tests/test_dev_and_verification_doc_index_sorting_contracts.py \
  src/yuantus/meta_engine/tests/test_odoo18_r2_portfolio_contract.py \
  src/yuantus/meta_engine/tests/test_tier_b_3_breakage_design_loopback_portfolio_contract.py

git diff --check
```

The S9 implementation PR should additionally run:

```bash
python3 clients/cad-desktop-helper/verify_bridge_static.py
dotnet test clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge.Tests/Yuantus.Cad.Bridge.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
```

If the real host Bridge project can build in GitHub Windows CI, also run:

```bash
dotnet build clients/cad-desktop-helper/Bridge/YuantusCadHelperBridge.csproj --configuration Release
```

If it cannot build without native CAD managed assemblies, the PR must state that
plainly and record deferred Windows native-CAD NETLOAD evidence.

## 7. DEV / Verification MD Requirements

The later S9 implementation PR must add:

```text
docs/DEV_AND_VERIFICATION_CAD_HELPER_BRIDGE_S9_LISP_BRIDGE_R1_20260523.md
```

That MD must record:

- exact implementation scope;
- target framework representation and actual output target;
- whether the real Bridge project built in CI or was static-verified only;
- all mandatory tests and their results;
- workflow run URL/status for `cad-helper-shared-dotnet`;
- static verifier output;
- explicit helper route count after S9;
- whether Windows native-CAD NETLOAD evidence was collected or deferred;
- all known deferred evidence items.

## 8. Non-Goals

S9-R1 does not include:

- S10 Lisp shell commands;
- `YUANTUS_DIFF_PREVIEW`;
- CAD command-line diff display;
- native-CAD DWG write-back;
- `/shell/notify`;
- `/dedup/check`;
- `DedupApiClient` migration;
- dedup-vision URL/token configuration;
- `/compose`;
- `/validate`;
- `/tasks`;
- `/diagnostics/snapshot`;
- CORS;
- server Python routes;
- helper route additions;
- SQLite schema changes;
- PLM schema changes;
- AutoCAD `CADDedupPlugin` behavior changes;
- SolidWorks client changes;
- installer/packaging changes beyond Bridge project files needed for R1;
- S11 end-to-end acceptance package.

## 9. Recommended Branch For Implementation

After this taskbook merges and only after a separate explicit opt-in, use:

```text
feat/cad-helper-bridge-s9-lisp-bridge-r1-20260523
```

Do not start S9 implementation from this taskbook PR.

## 10. Reviewer Focus

Please review these points before merge:

1. Confirm S9-R1 is limited to `YuantusCadHelperBridge.dll` transport bridge and
   does not include S10 Lisp commands.
2. Confirm endpoint validation in §3.C is mandatory and sufficient to stop
   absolute-URI / network-path / percent-encoding token exfiltration.
3. Confirm response shape in §3.E: return helper `data` JSON string, not the
   full helper envelope.
4. Confirm S9 may use SDK-free core tests plus static adapter verification for
   bridge logic if native CAD assemblies are unavailable in CI, while real CAD
   writer and NETLOAD evidence remain deferred operational signoff.
5. Confirm `/shell/notify` remains out of S9 even though it appears in the R3.2
   endpoint table.
6. Confirm helper route count remains ten.
7. Confirm native-CAD NETLOAD evidence may be deferred only if explicitly
   recorded as operational signoff, not claimed as tested.
8. Confirm §5 test 6 is only strict fake-based S9 wiring coverage and test 20 /
   static verifier pin that production wiring still reaches Shared
   `HelperLocator` and `HelperTransport`.

## 11. Status

This taskbook is ready for review once:

- the doc exists;
- `docs/DELIVERY_DOC_INDEX.md` references it;
- doc-index / R2 / Tier-B drift checks pass;
- `git diff --check` is clean.
