# YuantusPLM — Development Roadmap & TODO (current snapshot)

Date: 2026-06-17 · Original snapshot baseline `main` @ `91da3591`; **updated through `main` @ `279b44e4`** (MES line merged).
Status: **living snapshot** — the current **working roadmap** (execution entry point) as of this date.

## 0. Why this exists (read first)

The repo's **formal** planning docs (`DEVELOPMENT_NEXT_CYCLE_TODO_PLAN_*`, the Odoo gap
analyses) have gone **stale as TODO lists** — most of their items are already merged. Acting on
them this cycle repeatedly surfaced **already-done or non-issue** work (e.g. "CAD Material
Assistant" was fully built; an "erp 401/403 parity bug" already matched the ECM production
decision). This doc is the current **working roadmap / execution entry point**, grounded in the
**current code + git history**. It does **not** supersede the existing taskbooks and design docs
— those keep their authority as historical record and design background; they just should not be
read directly as the live TODO. **Re-verify any item against live code before starting** — that
discipline is exactly what the stale TODO lists lacked.

Sizes: S = ~1 PR, M = a few PRs / a thin taskbook, L = a multi-PR program.

## 0.1 Progress update — 2026-06-17 autonomous run (MERGED to main)

The **MES ingestion line is end-to-end COMPLETE on main** (sync + async). Landed:

- **R2.3 source_type widening** (scrap/rework) → **#785** (adversarial verify clean). **MERGED**.
- **R2.4 uom conversion** → taskbook **#784** + impl **#786** (convert within a dimension, else 422). **MERGED**.
- **MES audit tenant-attribution follow-up** → **#787** (the R2.2 security nit). **MERGED**.
- **R2.5 async** → taskbook **#788** + inbox mechanism **#789** + wiring **#794** (default-off:
  202-mode + inbox ops + worker drain; two real defects caught by adversarial verify and fixed —
  the poison-row terminal-failure + the async uom-mismatch parity). **MERGED**.
- **Tenant-baseline generator completeness + drift guard** → **#793** (a real new-tenant
  provisioning bug surfaced by a merge-train dry-run: the generator omitted `approval_automation`,
  so a regen dropped a per-tenant table; now complete + an order-independent subprocess drift guard
  in CI). Supersedes the closed #790. **MERGED**.
- Verified on merged main: route count **716**, single migration head `mes_inbox_001`, full
  contract suite **113 passed**.
- **C3 taskbook** → **#792** **MERGED** (impl still owner-deferred; see §3).
- **Re-verification correction**: the **jti revocation denylist is cross-repo-blocked**, not cleanly
  Yuantus-actionable — the embed token is verified **OFFLINE by the consumer (metasheet2)**, so a
  Yuantus-side denylist enforces nothing without a metasheet2 change, and it contradicts the
  offline-verify design (which is *why* the model relies on the ≤600s TTL). It belongs with the
  not-yet-opted SSO slice, alongside MetaSheet bridge. Re-classified below.

## 1. Delivered (recent, with PR refs)

- **MES ingestion line** (the current active line) — secured end to end:
  - R1 contract (#567) → **R2** route + DB idempotency (#778) → **R2.1** uom reconciliation
    (#779) → **R2.2** dedicated credential / fixed-tenant auth boundary (#781 taskbook, #782
    impl). Each has a `DEV_AND_VERIFICATION_…` doc on main.
- **PLM → ECM publish line** — live-proven (P0 #763 … P1E worker-E2E #775; live PASS recorded).
- Broader programs already closed (verified during the survey): CAD Material Assistant Phases 1–4
  (#704/#707/#711/#721), OdooPLM parity, CAD-PDM borrow program.

## 2. MES ingestion line — ✅ END-TO-END COMPLETE on main (2026-06-17)

The active line is **done and merged** (R1 → R2.2 previously; R2.3 → R2.5 this run). Order was
owner-ratified: secure the entrypoint (R2.2) → widen sources (R2.3) → convert units (R2.4) →
async (R2.5), plus the R2.2 audit-attribution follow-up. Items below kept for the record with
their landing PRs. Verified on merged main: route count 716, single migration head
`mes_inbox_001`, full contract suite 113 passed.

- [x] **R2.3 — `source_type` widening** · **DONE #785**. `ALLOWED_SOURCE_TYPES` is now
  `frozenset({"mes", "workorder", "scrap", "rework"})` (`services/consumption_mes_contract.py`) —
  the two new **positive-consumption** sources are `scrap` (material consumed and scrapped during
  the run) and `rework` (material consumed reprocessing a defect). The R1 contract drift tests +
  the `ALLOWED_…` assertion were updated; idempotency / uom / variance and the manual `/actuals`
  path are unaffected.
  **Stayed out of scope (still a separate future taskbook)**: `return` / 冲销 / any reversal
  (negative) semantics. The MES contract enforces `actual_quantity >= 0` (DTO
  `_finite_non_negative`) and `variance` only **sums** (no reverse offset), so a reversal source
  cannot be a plain enum value — it needs negative quantity or an explicit offset mechanism +
  variance changes.

- [x] **R2.4 — unit conversion** · **DONE #784 (taskbook) + #786 (impl)**. Converts `event.uom` →
  `plan.uom` within a dimension; an unknown / cross-dimension pair keeps the **422**
  (`consumption_mes_uom_unconvertible`). Versioned conversion table, 6-dp rounding, audit envelope.

- [x] **R2.5 — async inbox + worker** · **DONE #788 (taskbook) + #789 (inbox mechanism) + #794
  (wiring)**. Default-OFF (`MES_INGEST_ASYNC`): the route persists the event to the
  `meta_mes_consumption_inbox` and returns 202; `drain_once` processes it through the same
  `ingest_mes_consumption`; admin-gated inbox ops (list/get/replay). Two real defects caught by
  adversarial verify and fixed: the poison-row terminal-failure and the async uom-mismatch parity.

- [x] **Follow-up: MES audit attribution** · **DONE #787**. `TenantOrgContextMiddleware` skips
  header-derived tenant/org for the machine MES path (`_is_mes_ingest_path`), so the audit row no
  longer records a caller-supplied `x-tenant-id` for it. (Recording the *bound*
  `MES_INGEST_TENANT_ID` precisely remains a noted larger follow-up.)

- **Cross-cutting fix this run**: **tenant-baseline generator completeness + drift guard** →
  **DONE #793** (supersedes the closed #790). A merge-train dry-run found the generator omitted
  `approval_automation`, so a regeneration silently dropped a per-tenant table; now complete, with
  an order-independent subprocess drift guard registered in CI.

## 3. Non-MES candidates (from the survey — RE-VERIFY current state before starting)

Not freshly re-verified beyond a spot check this turn; the survey was mid-session. Confirm
against live code first.

- [ ] **PLM-COLLAB jti revocation denylist** · security · **RE-CLASSIFIED 2026-06-17:
  cross-repo-BLOCKED** (was "S, Yuantus-local"). Re-verification showed the embed token is
  **verified OFFLINE by the consumer (metasheet2)** — Yuantus only mints. A Yuantus-side denylist
  table/endpoint would enforce **nothing** (the offline consumer can't consult it), and online
  revocation contradicts the offline-verify design that the ≤600s TTL exists to bound. Real
  revocation needs a cross-repo decision (online verify, or a polled/synced revocation list) =
  the not-yet-opted SSO slice. Not a clean Yuantus-only build.

- [ ] **CAD-PDM C3 — date-BOM auto-obsolete + where-used propagation** · size **M–L** ·
  **taskbook ready (#792, MERGED); impl owner-prioritization-gated**. A genuine new feature (date
  trigger via a polling worker — no cron infra — + B1 `is_superseded` obsolete + upward where-used
  **flag, not cascade**). The "taskbook-first" gate is satisfied; the only remaining gate is the
  owner's prioritization + ratification of the taskbook's open questions.

- [ ] **MetaSheet bridge activation** · size **M** · SSO-gated. `api/routers/metasheet_bridge.py`
  still returns a static `{"active": false, "entitlement_required": true}`. Depends on the
  SSO/identity-session decision (the same parent slice as the jti item).

## 4. Explicitly NOT actionable (blocked on external / non-code — do not pick)

- render-service **S3** (docker-compose e2e) and visual-diff **L2** — need the external VemCAD
  render image (not available locally).
- **G2** named-vendor ERP adapter — the publication spine is closed behind a registry seam; a
  concrete adapter exists only when a concrete target does.
- **G1 / G6** native-CAD signoff / production-scale evidence — hardware/operator-gated.
- erp 401/403 "parity" — **verified a non-issue**; erp already matches the ECM Transfer
  production decision (cred/scope → terminal).

## 5. Recommended next action

The **MES ingestion line is complete and merged** (§2). The remaining roadmap work is gated on the
owner, not on more solo build:

1. **CAD-PDM C3** — the taskbook is ready (#792). Needs the owner to **prioritize** + ratify its
   open questions; then it's a bounded build (polling worker + obsolete + where-used flag).
2. **jti denylist / MetaSheet bridge** — both need the **SSO / cross-repo decision** (they live
   behind metasheet2 + the not-yet-opted identity-session slice); not clean Yuantus-only builds.

## 6. Maintenance

Point-in-time snapshot (`2026-06-17`, original `main@91da3591`, **updated through `main@279b44e4`**
after the MES line merged). Update it as slices land; **re-verify any item against current code/git
before starting** — the formal plan docs went stale precisely because that step was skipped.
