# Aras Parity Scorecard

## 1. Metrics Definition

This scorecard tracks parity-to-surpass progress against roadmap scope.

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Capability coverage rate | Delivered roadmap capabilities / planned capabilities |
| Quality pass rate | Green runs / required runs under strict gates |
| Performance attainment rate | Met performance targets / total performance targets |
| Leading capability count | Number of capabilities measurably ahead of Aras baseline in target scenarios |

## 2. Current Snapshot (2026-02-06)

| Metric | Current |
|---|---|
| Capability coverage rate | 4 / 6 phases with implemented core capability (`66.7%`) |
| Quality pass rate | `100%` (targeted + nonDB + DB + Playwright all green in latest M1 run) |
| Performance attainment rate | Pending weekly benchmark execution |
| Leading capability count | 1 (strict lifecycle + guardrail automation in manufacturing track) |

## 3. Notes

- Capability coverage is phase-level and intentionally conservative.
- Performance metrics must be updated after weekly benchmark run against roadmap section 9.3.
- Leading capability count requires scenario evidence and reproducible verification records.
