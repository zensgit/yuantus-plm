## Results

| Scenario | Target | Measured | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dedup batch (1000 files) processing | < 10m | - | SKIP | enqueue_only: created_jobs=1000, enqueue_time=289.9ms; processing requires worker+vision |
| Config BOM calculation (500 levels) | < 5s | 96.2ms | PASS | depth=500, config_selection_keys=['Color'] |
| MBOM conversion (1000 lines) | < 30s | 532.5ms | PASS | lines=1000, substitutes=0 |
| Baseline create (2000 members) | < 60s | 423.8ms | PASS | max_levels=1, item_count=2000 |
| Full-text search response (p95 over 10 runs) | < 500ms | 5.8ms | PASS | engine=db, query='PERF-SEARCH', p50=5.5ms, p95=5.8ms |
| Electronic signature verify (p95 over 20 runs) | < 100ms | 0.2ms | PASS | p50=0.2ms, p95=0.2ms |

## Summary

- PASS: 5
- FAIL: 0
- SKIP: 1

## Notes

- SKIP entries indicate missing external dependencies or not-yet-wired benchmark harness paths.
- Search measurement uses p95 over 10 runs; e-sign verification uses p95 over 20 runs.
