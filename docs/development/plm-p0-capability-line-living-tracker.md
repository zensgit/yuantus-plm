# PLM P0 capability line — LIVING tracker (claim board)

> **Single living source of truth for the P0 capability line. UPDATE IT IN PLACE** — do not spawn
> dated snapshot docs per slice. **Claim a surface in §2 before building it** (one owner/branch per
> surface). Operating rules mirror `plm-collab-integration-line-living-tracker.md` §4.
> Formal basis: `docs/PLM_CAPABILITY_GAP_ANALYSIS_20260702.md` (conclusion baseline
> `origin/main@8959d844`). Opened/gated status below records the owner's 拍板 of **2026-07-02**.

## 1. Owner decisions (2026-07-02)

- **OPEN**: P0-① notification delivery + subscriptions. P0-⑧a Method sandbox and P0-⑧b inbound
  rate limiting are complete as two separate security-debt slices.
- **OPEN on the integration line** (claimed THERE, not here): locked-BOM ECO revision route
  **Phase 0 (contract-first)** — see `plm-collab-integration-line-living-tracker.md` §2.
- **GATED** (each needs its own explicit opt-in before any taskbook/code): P0-② unified task
  inbox, P0-③ workflow semantics + REST, P0-④ document full-text search, P0-⑤ bulk import,
  P0-⑥ mass-replace wizard, P0-⑦ ECR/ECN objects, P0-⑨ form/grid admin API, P0-⑩ GraphQL
  mount-or-delete decision; all P1/P2 report items.
- Phase-6 SSO: stays **deferred**. Date-obsolete DP1-iii and the commercial subset: stay **gated**.

## 2. Surfaces (the claim board)

| Surface | State | Owner / branch (claim) | Hard technical premises (owner findings 2026-07-02) & gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-⑧a Method script sandbox | ✅ DONE — taskbook + implementation + design/verification record. Scripts route through RestrictedPython; module hooks are fail-closed behind `METHOD_MODULE_ALLOWLIST`; Method RPC is fail-closed behind `METHOD_RPC_ENABLED` + admin/superuser. | claude / `feat/p0-8a-method-sandbox` | Four execution surfaces were cut over together: two script paths (`business_logic/executor.py`, `services/method_service.py`) and two module paths. Tests pin import/open/dunder/context-guard escapes, module allowlist, RPC gate, resource caps, and audit emission. The separate RPC identity-default defect remains gated; with `METHOD_RPC_ENABLED=false` by default, Method execution is closed until that adjacent slice is explicitly opened. |
| P0-⑧b Inbound rate limiting | ✅ DONE — default-off process-local token-bucket middleware with explicit env enablement. | codex / `codex/p0-8b-rate-limit` | Middleware order is pinned as RequestLogging → Auth → InboundRateLimit → TenantOrgContext → Audit. Protected traffic keys on verified `request.state.tenant_id`; public/unauthenticated traffic keys on client IP and ignores untrusted tenant headers. Exempt health/docs/openapi paths stay open; zero budgets disable enforcement. This is not a distributed/global quota. |
| P0-① Notification delivery + subscriptions | 🔨 OPEN — taskbook delivered; implementation next | codex / `codex/p0-1-notification-taskbook` | The generic event layer is an **after-commit in-memory EventBus** (`events/transactional.py:48` → `events/event_bus.py`): no persistence, retry, dead-letter, or delivery state — trigger source ONLY. Implementation MUST add persistent **NotificationOutbox/Delivery tables + a dedicated worker** (pattern: `erp_publication`/`ecm_publication` outbox: state machine, retry, dead-letter, idempotency fingerprint). Delivery adapters: SMTP first, IM/webhook later. Subscription model + digest coalescing follows the reliability cut. |
| P0-②③④⑤⑥⑦⑨⑩ | ⛔ GATED | — | Per-item opt-in. Sequencing guidance in the report §"三批次" plan: ②③ after ① (催办/分发 depend on delivery); ⑦ after the ECO-route Phases 1–2 (same change domain — claim-before-build). |
| P1 / P2 report items | ⛔ GATED | — | See report §五. |

## 3. Delivery shape (every slice, no exceptions)

1. taskbook (scope-lock, source-grounded) → impl PR → external review; **one slice, one PR**.
2. New feature keys registered in `FEATURE_APP_NAMES` + SKU mapping; gate via `is_entitled` only
   (writes: `require_admin_user` before `is_entitled`; reads: auth → entitlement → query).
3. New routers update the route-pin contract tests; new test files added to the ci.yml explicit
   list AND every other CI enumeration (conftest allowlist, portfolio globs); new env vars
   declared in `Settings`.
4. Alembic stays single-head; new tables always via migration trees.
5. Consumer pact stays green; outward payload changes run dry-run + contract validation first.
