"""PLM-COLLAB-V2 seats (Option A): project a license's paid seat cap into the
identity-side ``TenantQuota.max_users`` at license-import time.

Design of record: ``docs/development/plm-collab-v2-seats-design-20260619.md`` (Option A,
owner-ratified). In one paragraph:

- A vendor-signed license payload optionally carries ``seats`` (a positive int = the
  number of users the tenant's paid seat pack covers).
- ``yuantus license import`` commits the license first (it is the commercial source of
  truth), then calls this helper **best-effort** to land ``seats`` onto the identity-side
  ``TenantQuota.max_users`` -- the *same* cap the existing ``QuotaService`` /
  ``_apply_quota_limits`` provisioning gate already enforces at ``POST /admin/users``,
  itself gated by ``QUOTA_MODE`` (default ``disabled`` -> ships inert).
- ``is_entitled()`` never touches seats: feature authorization and seat-cap enforcement
  are separate code paths. This helper is the only meta<->identity hop, and it is a single
  import-time write, never a hot-path join (the limit and the active-user count both live
  identity-side, so enforcement stays single-DB).

Fail-open by contract: the caller runs this *after* the license is committed and treats any
raised exception as non-fatal. A transient identity-DB failure must never un-activate a
valid paid license; with ``QUOTA_MODE`` default-off a missing cap is inert, and re-running
the import re-projects (``upsert_quota`` is idempotent).
