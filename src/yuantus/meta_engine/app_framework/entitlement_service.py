"""Entitlement-check kernel for PLM Collaboration features (PLM-COLLAB-P1-B).

`is_entitled(feature_key)` converges the "is this feature available for the current
tenant?" decision to ONE place. It reuses the P1-A tenant scope resolver
(``license_scope.resolve_license_scope``) so there is no second, unscoped license
read path -- a NULL-tenant or other-tenant license can never unlock the current
tenant, and a non-single deployment without tenant context raises (it is not
swallowed into a plain False).

Lit keys: ``plm_collaboration_pro`` (P1-B), ``approval_automation`` (P2-A ->
``plm.approval_automation``) and ``bom_multitable`` (P3-B -> ``plm.bom_multitable``) --
each an independent, separately-sellable SKU. The other canonical feature keys are
accepted (so a typo is caught, not silently treated as unlicensed) but map to an
empty app-name set -> always False until a later slice lights them. ``license_data``
is NOT an authorization source.
