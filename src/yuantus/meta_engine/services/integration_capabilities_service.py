"""PLM-COLLAB-P2.5 (Integration Handshake): the integration capability manifest.

Generalizes the P2-D scenario capability entry into a single provider-wide handshake a
consumer (MetaSheet) queries on connect to learn "what does this PLM instance support,
and what is this tenant entitled to?", so it can degrade/upgrade gracefully instead of
locking step with PLM deploys.

INVARIANTS (owner-ratified):
- ADVISORY ONLY. The manifest is a UI/degradation hint; it is NEVER an authorization
  source. The real gate stays enforced at every feature endpoint (is_entitled at each
  /context, /actions, /provision call). A stale or spoofed manifest must not be a
  bypass -- hence ``advisory: true`` in the body.
- ``entitled`` is computed ONLY by ``EntitlementService.is_entitled`` (the single
  judgment path) -- never a second/reimplemented check, never a ``license_data`` read.
- ``supported`` = the feature key is LIT in ``FEATURE_APP_NAMES`` (maps to a non-empty
  app-name set). Derived from the registry, tenant-INDEPENDENT.
- Cache boundary is explicit per feature: ``supported`` is tenant-independent (global-
  cacheable); ``entitled`` is tenant-dependent and must NOT be cached across tenants.
- ``schema_version`` is the manifest's own contract version; it evolves additively
  only (same discipline as the committed Pact). It deliberately does NOT expose the
  internal app route-count pin.
- The manifest performs NO write and NO resource (ECO/etc.) lookup.
